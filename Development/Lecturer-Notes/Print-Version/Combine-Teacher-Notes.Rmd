## ============== USAGE NOTES ===================
## runtime: shiny is required for html in children files to be interpreted correctly (i.e. colspan elements to work)
## the generated file CANNOT be pushed directly to shinyapps.io in this form - shinyapps.io does not get the combined html file after pandoc.
## It is advised that for later deployment the individual files are copy and pasted directly into here, providing ONE file that can be uploaded directly to shinyapps.io
## Otherwise replace embeddded shinyapps with iframes to these shinyapps.
