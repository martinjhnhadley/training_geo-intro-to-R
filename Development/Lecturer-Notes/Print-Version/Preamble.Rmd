## Course Overview

This course is designed as a broad overview of how presentations and interactive content can be built using the R language and R Markdown.


No prior knowledge of R is expected, however this course will **NOT** provide a sufficient overview of the R language to start analysing data and doing useful stuff.


>* This course shows you how to make Shiny stuff.

## Scope of Course

This course will introduce the necessary skills to build interactive elements similar to the following examples from the [shiny.rstudio.com](http://shiny.rstudio.com) gallery.

## Scope of Course

The very basics of using supplementary packages for creating Shiny apps with highly interactive charts (ie. pan, zoom and tooltips) will be introduced.

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
## Example from http://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/movie-explorer.html
## All rights reserved
library(shiny)
library(plotly)
library(ggplot2movies)
minx <- min(movies$rating)
maxx <- max(movies$rating)
shinyApp(
  ui = fluidPage(
  titlePanel("Movie Ratings!"),
  sidebarPanel(
    sliderInput("bins", "Number of bins:", min = 1, max = 50, value = 10)
  ),
  mainPanel(
    plotlyOutput("trendPlot")
  )
),
  server = function(input, output) {

  output$trendPlot <- renderPlotly({
    # size of the bins depend on the input 'bins'
    size <- (maxx - minx) / input$bins

    # a simple histogram of movie ratings
    p <- plot_ly(movies, x = rating, autobinx = F, type = "histogram",
                 xbins = list(start = minx, end = maxx, size = size))
    # style the xaxis
    layout(p, xaxis = list(title = "Ratings", range = c(minx, maxx), autorange = F,
                           autotick = F, tick0 = minx, dtick = size))
  })
},
options = list(height = 500, width = "100%")
)
```


```{r fig.width=4,echo=FALSE}
library(png)
library(grid)
img <- readPNG("images/movie-ratings-Shiny-Gallery-Example.png")
 grid.raster(img)
```


The course does not cover the development of this type of applications:

```{r fig.width=4,echo=FALSE}
library(png)
library(grid)
img <- readPNG("images/EMLO-Screenshot.png")
 grid.raster(img)
```


## Course Materials and Structure

The lecturer notes for this course have been written in R Markdown and will be provided to you at the end of the course.


There are a number of exercise files provided for you on the desktop in the folder "R and Shiny".


The course will cover the following topics:


>* The R Language
>* RStudio
>* R Markdoown
>* RPub
>* Shiny

## The R Language

R is a scripting language and a very powerful tool for data analysis and presentation, primarily due to the huge user base and their dedication to developing free and open source libraries/packages covering a vast range of different knowledge domains:


- Regression
- Machine Learning
- Image Analysis
- Network Analysis

<p>

The Comprehensive R Archive Network [(CRAN)](cran.r-project.org) is the canonical repository for R packages, note that almost all* packages hosted on CRAN may be used within a Shiny app.


*\*Packages dependent on parallal or distributed computing are unlikely to be supported, contact shinyapps-support@rstudio.com with any questions*

## Learning R

Oxford provides a variety of courses on R in the [ITLP Catalog](http://courses.it.ox.ac.uk), if there are additional courses you would like to see run please do ask!


Oxford also provides access to [lynda.com](http://lynda.com) for all staff and students at the University, Lynda provides training material on a whole host of programming languages and analytical techniques.


[Datacamp.com](datacamp.com) is a tool for learning the R language and analytical techniques directly in the browser - note that a subscription is required to access some content.

## Getting Help

[Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) is the Q&A community for programming and scripting, this is a good place to start when trying to solve a problem. Note that the community may see abrasive to new users, the following advice is useful to prevent feeling like your fingers have been snapped off:

- Search for a solution before asking a question
- Provide a [reproducible example of your problem](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example)

## The R Console

R is the name of the programming language and *console* within which many users of R write and evaluate their code.

To use R on your local machine you must [download](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) and install the R Console, it's available on Windows, OS X and Linux.

Like all consoles, this application provides (only) the following functionality:

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6">
- Write code and script files
- Evaluate code and script files
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-6">
<img src="images/RConsole.png" width = "100%"/>
  </div>
</div>
