## Literature Overview

The iris dataset is used frequently to demonstrate how R works, or a particular analytical technique, the dataset has measurements for `r nrow[iris]` different fish in it.


## Summarising Iris

This is the standard scatter plot used for testing the performance of clustering algorithms.

```{r iris_plot}
plot(iris$Petal.Length, iris$Petal.Width, pch=21, 
     bg=c("red","green3","blue")[unclass(iris$Species)], 
     main="Edgar Anderson's Iris Data")
```


The distribution of fish across the species can be displayed as follows, note that the distribution is shown as a percentage:

```{r iris-species-table}
100*table(iris$Species)/nrow(Iris)
```
